All communication is established\u00a0via calls, on-line meetings and e-mails. A process is set up to create a custom\u00a0design that meets client style, space and budget.<\/p>\n<p>Interiors E-design is ideal for room makeover (bedroom, children\u2019s room, living room, dining room, office), renovation (kitchen, bathroom) and\u00a0color palette (apartment, house, office).<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We arrange a 1 hour call, free of charge and with no obligation, to discuss your project. Following this call, you will receive a quote detailing the Interiors E-design process and package. If you decide to go further with our collaboration, the Interiors E-design process will take place as follows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You complete the design questionnaire to establish requirements and budget. Send any images and links you find insightful.<\/li>\n<li>You provide photos and measurements of the room. Include photos and measurements of items you wish to keep.<\/li>\n<li>20% prepayment of the quote is required, to launch the work on the Interiors E-design package.<\/li>\n<li>Elaboration of the Interiors E-design package typically lasts from 2 to 3 weeks. Please note that 1 round of revisions is included in the package.<\/li>\n<li>80% final payment after delivery.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>How much does it cost?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Fees start at 500 \u20ac or 3700 dkk per room. Please get in touch for custom quotes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does it include?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Interiors E-design package includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mood board showing the inspiration vibe and including colors, materials and textures.<\/li>\n<li>Floor plan to scale including both existing and new items.<\/li>\n<li>Interior\u00a0elevation to scale detailing window treatment and wall decor.<\/li>\n<li>Vision board and color palette illustrating the look and feel of the room.<\/li>\n<li>Shopping list with links to recommended items and design notes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Interiors E-design?
